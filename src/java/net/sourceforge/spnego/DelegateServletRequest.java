/**
 * The default installation of Internet Explorer and Active Directory 
 * allow the user's/requester's credential to be delegated.
 *
 * <p>
 * By default, {@link SpnegoHttpURLConnection} has delegation set 
 * to false. To allow delegation, call the <code>requestCredDeleg</code> 
 * method on the <code>SpnegoHttpURLConnection</code> instance.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Also, the server/service's pre-authentication account must be specified as 
 * "Account is trusted for delegation" in Active Directory.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Finally, the server/service's spnego servlet init params must be specified 
 * to allow credential delegation by setting the property 
 * <code>spnego.allow.delegation</code> to true (false by default).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Custom client programs may request their credential to be delegated 
 * by calling the <code>requestCredDeleg</code> on their instance of GSSContext.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Java Application Servers can obtain the delegated credential by casting 
 * the HTTP request.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Example usage:</b>
 * <pre>
 *     if (request instanceof DelegateServletRequest) {
 *         DelegateServletRequest dsr = (DelegateServletRequest) request;
 *         GSSCredential creds = dsr.getDelegatedCredential();
 *         ...
 *     }
 * </pre>

 * <a href="http://spnego.sourceforge.net/credential_delegation.html" 
 * target="_blank">credential delegation example</a>.
